My Assignment : Using the angular2, create a web page that shuffles a standard deck of 52 cards, and then deals them in a matrix of 13 columns by 4 rows. Calculate the percentage that the deckis in the correct order and store the deck configuration and the percentage in the database. Display an average percentage across all historical percentages. Display the deck on the screen with a button that says "Shuffle Cards" to deal the next deck. All business logic should be handled on the angular 2 side only. Isolate your card generation and shuffling algorithm. 

For every card that is in the correct suited row, add one point For every card that is in the correct column, add one point

Max points = 104

♠︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
♣︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
♥︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
♦︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
This configuration would give you 104 points = 100% correct order
